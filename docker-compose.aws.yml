# AWS Production Docker Compose Override
# Used with: docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.aws.yml
# Don't use the override file which is intended for local development

services:
    webserver:
        # No volumes mount - code is baked into the image
        ports:
            # Lightsail will handle HTTPS/SSL, route traffic to port 80
            - '80:80'
        # Uses gunicorn from Dockerfile CMD (no override)

    db:
        # Database only accessible internally in Lightsail
        # No external port exposure for security
